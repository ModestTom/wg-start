# WireGuard Startup Script

![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=modesttom.wg-start&left_color=gray&right_color=blue)

**This project is a simple bash script that is for the purpose of utilizing multiple [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) configurations (you do not need multiple).**



## Requirements

- A Linux Distribution
- WireGuard installation. See [WireGuard Installer](https://github.com/angristan/wireguard-install) for a quick and easy installation.
- This script searches for configurations in WireGuard's default configuration directory `/etc/wireguard`

## Usage

Download and run the script. I personally store it in `/usr/bin` but you may run it from anywhere.
